            Hello there! I am a CSE student from Bangladesh who is passionate
            about programming, ML research, and web development. With my
            experience in solving programming problems, I have gained a strong
            foundation in coding and problem-solving skills. In my free time, I
            enjoy participating in coding competitions, where I can put my
            skills to the test and collaborate with other like-minded
            individuals. Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning web
            development

                This system was built with a target towards automating the
                manual processes of creating course oultines according to OBE
                formats for university teachers. The system is meant to also
                support automated spider chart generation of student details
                such as CGPA, credits completed etc

                identify potential users for the application and identify the
                probable uses of such users through the app. This project is
                still a work in progress, hence the link does not work

          Currently, there exists no automated technology to diagnose a patient
          with leukemia just by analyzing the peripheral blood smear obtained
          from a blood test. Our research focuses around the idea of designing a
          Machine Learning model that would be trained on existing data set to
          verify cancerous blood cells from a blood smear, ultimately automating
          the process of detecting leukemia, and reducing the time delay
          currently present in the diagnosis process by experts

                in the next editions of Techfest, the bot was made mobile and
